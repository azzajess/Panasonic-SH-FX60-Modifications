# Modification 1 - Convert unit to support RCA/3.5mm Input 
Adds RCA/3.5mm input into the base, converting to to a simple stereo amplifier.

This will require the base unit to be opened

1. Take out the 4 deep screws on the back.
2. Take out the single screw next to the speaker terminals
3. Pull it open it from the front (be careful there is a flat cable connected to the main audio board
4. Disconnect the flat cable from the front of the unit to the audio board
5. You will also have to unscrew the board on the front of the unit. Behind there you will need to bridge either pin 5 & 7 or 6 & 8. Image below for reference

6. Disconnect the flat cable from the audio board to the power supply board
7. Pull out the audio board, being careful of the blue wire still soldered on.
8. Once out, you can wire up the RCA/3.5m audio jack to the underneath of the audio board using the below pinout diagram.

9. You will also have to think of a way to mount the RCA/3.5mm jack on the unit. I drill out holes on the front and mounted the RCA's with hot glue. (Didnt have a stereo RCA so just setteled for a 4 way)
10. Once done, make sure to test before assembling everything back together to make sure its workingas intended. Just be mindful of the powersupply board.
11. Assemble and enjoy.
