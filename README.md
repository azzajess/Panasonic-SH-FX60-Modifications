# Panasonic-SH-FX60-Modifications
Modifications for Panasonic SH-FX60 Wireless Upgrade Kit
Uses a TDA8920B Class D Amp
```
Output Power Stereo & ±27 V (I think the powersupply is supplying 30V on this unit?)
          
  3 Ω
    THD = 0.5 % - 87  W
    THD = 10  % - 110 W
  4 Ω
    THD = 0.5 % - 69  W
    THD = 10  % - 86  W
  6 Ω
    THD = 0.5 % - 48  W
    THD = 10  % - 60  W
  8 Ω
    THD = 0.5 % - 36  W
    THD = 10  % - 45  W
```


## [Modification 1 - Convert unit to support RCA/3.5mm Input ](https://github.com/azzajess/Panasonic-SH-FX60-Modifications/blob/main/Mod1-Stereo-Input.md)
Adds RCA/3.5mm input into the base, converting to to a simple stereo amplifier.




## [Modification 2 - Utilise the Wireless function for other devices](https://github.com/azzajess/Panasonic-SH-FX60-Modifications/blob/main/Mod2-Wireless-Input.md)
This will allow you to convert the wireless functionality to support a stereo input to be wirelessly transmitted to the amplifer base.
Do note, its a bit finicky and can sometimes loose connection
