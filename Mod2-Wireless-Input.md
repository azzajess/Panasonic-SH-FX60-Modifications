# Modification 2 - Utilise the Wireless function for other devices
This will allow you to use the wireless functionality on any device with an audio output.

This modification will probably ruin the plastic transmitter thing and wont close properly due to the wires. Might have to make some sort of modification or use tape to keep it closed.

1. Disassembly the wireless module
2. On the front, connect mute to ground with a wire like image below

3. Wire up 5v and ground for voltage and then wire the audio input lead to the L, R and ground audio pinout like the image below

4. Assemble what you can and give it a test run.
